Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n  (0,_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_inheritsLoose__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__[\"default\"])(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?
